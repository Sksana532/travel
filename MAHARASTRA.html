            <span>

Since 1869, this Gothic structure has lent stately grace to stalls selling everything you could possibly need from paper cups to puppies. It‚Äôs one of Mumbai‚Äôs oldest covered markets and it was the first building in the country to get electric lighting. Though the name was officially changed to Jyotiba Phule Mandai after independence, everyone still calls it Crawford Market. It‚Äôs closed on Sundays but, on other days, this is the best place to get fruits, nuts and vegetables at wholesale rates.

            <span>

Hill Road in Bandra is where everyone goes shopping for clothes that aren‚Äôt really meant to last, the kind you wear for a season and then replace. T-shirts, dresses, pyjamas and shoes are found within the shops and displayed on the pavement (you read that right). After marvelling at the cheap prices, check out the old-timey bakeries in the area and the old arcade, Elco, now more famous for its delectable street food offerings.

            <span>

Chor Bazaar or the Thieves‚Äô Market is really a flea market in a different guise. Saturday to Thursday, it‚Äôs a hunting ground for antiques and discards. It‚Äôs a great place to look for Bollywood posters and gadgets‚Äîgramophone player, anyone?‚Äîas well as clocks, ceramic door knobs and tiles. You could decorate a whole bedsit from these shops. Though they may not be thieves, the shopkeepers will definitely try to fleece you, so halve their asking price and haggle hard.

If the cr√©pe place and the organic caf√© have yet to convince you that it is mostly expats that live here, the fact that the vegetable vendors all speak English should do it.

Not really a market, more a long street lined with shops that retail leather, this is the place for cheap boots and bags. Until 1996, the slum of Dharavi, which sprawls on either side, used to house all the leather tanneries. These have moved, but the traders still live and work here, selling not just shoes that can be made to order in two days, but also designer handbags and wallets leftover from big fashion house orders.

Although this isn‚Äôt technically a single market, each lane in the area facing Crawford Market specializes in certain goods. Baking supplies? There‚Äôs a street for that. Curtains and other furnishings? Yup, turn left. Lights, lamps, lanterns for indoor or outdoor spaces? Check out that entire lane. Stationery, kitchen appliances, home d√©cor, artificial plants and flowers, handbags and even plumbing supplies are found in dedicated areas, also known as gullie. The mere browsing is delightful.
