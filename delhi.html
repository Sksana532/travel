          <div class="price">2. Palika Bazaar And Janpath Market <span>
              An underground market located between the inner and outer circle of Connaught Place, Palika Bazar houses
              15,000 people within its confines at any given time. Set up in the late 1970s, it has 380 numbered shops
              selling a varied range of objects where electronic items and clothing are dominant and is one of the best
              places to visit in Delhi for all the shopaholics.

              <br>Tip: Hold onto your bags a little tighter as things might get stolen in this packed marketplace of
              Palika.
              Janpath Market is another market in CP & the lane connects it to Lodhi Road. This place overflows with the
              shops and stalls at the roadside selling large numbers of goods.

              <br>Opening hours: 10 am till late late evening
              P.S. Apart from these, there are places, I bet you, which offer such wide ranges and throw away prices
              that you can be that ‘must-to-go-shopping-with guy’. Go to Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, and Karol Bagh.

          <div class="price"> Plum by Bent Chair, Aerocity<span>

              <br>The Plum is often said to be the most Instagrammable restaurant in India. The decor is gorgeous with
              loads – we mean – LOADS of creative decorables. From the cutlery to the wall art, from the furniture to
              the food. Also, you can buy a lot of their decorables on the spot. Basically, if Pinterest was a
              restaurant, this would be exactly it.

              <br>Must Try: Thai Mojito, Elderflower, Baos
              <br>Location:22, Janpath Road, Janpath, New Delhi
              <br>Timings: 12 PM – 1 AM
              <br>Cost for Two: 2,200 INR

          <div class="price"> Sagar Ratna, New Defence Colony<span>
              <br> If you’re looking for South Indian restaurants in Delhi, then look no further than the Sagar Ratna.
              It’s now a chain spread all over the city with the original one located in New Defence Colony. Also, we
              recommend ordering their South Indian coffee. Served in an old-school steel glass, it’ll remind you of
              your dad’s morning routine with a newspaper and chai.

              <br>Must Try: Ghee Roast Masala Dosa, Idli Chaat, Aloo Masala, Dahi Vada
              <br>Location: New Defence Colony
              <br>Timings:8 am – 11 pm
              <br>Cost for Two: 500 INR
