             There is just one place to go if you want to look for wedding dresses and lovely sarees, and the famous place is Saree Mandir.

Odisha has something if you are a saree lover-

Kotpad Sarees: These sarees are typically handwoven by the Odisha tribes of Koraput. The heftiness and roughness of coarsely woven fabric are indicative of handmade products.
Pasapalli Saree: This is the one that resembles a chessboard, usually constructed out of black and white with a splash of red. It is the most common Odisha saree, one which all Odisha women wear with little variation. But these sarees are quite expensive.
Sambalpuri Ikkat Saree: This is the unique saree that is sewn using thread that has been coloured. The strategy requires a clear sense of design such that the right thread is positioned in the right place and makes the fabric very colourful. Designs may be intricate, although light fabrics are typically used in these.
Bomkai Sarees: These sarees emerge in Odisha, Ganjam district, and are well known for the finest borders and Pallas. Typically, you notice fish motifs on these sarees that are deemed favourable.
Sea Beach market: There are three big beach markets close to Puri seaside where you can see the very crowd; the three places are the Swargadwara area, the area in front of the Puri hotel, and the Penthokota area. You will mainly find shops and stalls selling seashell products in these areas, such as items made out of shells and oysters and handloom products.
Orissa Modern Art Gallery: The only gallery in the state of Odisha that presents a permanent display of selected contemporary works of art is the Orissa Modern Art Gallery (OMAG). It has been established as a means to promote Odishan contemporary art artists. Mrs Karen Kent and Tarakant Parida founded the Orissa Modern Art Gallery in India.
