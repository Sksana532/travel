World's oldest living city, Varanasi - also known as Kashi (City of Life) and Benaras, is the spiritual capital of India. It is one of Hinduism's seven holy cities. The old city of Varanasi lies along the western banks of the Ganges, spread across a labyrinth of narrow galis. Be prepared to walk on foot and encounter some holy cows! Temples at almost every turn engulf Varanasi but the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the most visited and the oldest of the lot. Benaras is known as the city of Lord Shiva for a reason, and rightfully so.

Varanasi is considered an auspicious place to die, as it is believed to grant moksha or liberation from the cycle of life and death.

Ayodhya, located on the banks of river Sarayu in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the seven sacred cities for Hindus. Ayodhya plays a critical role in the Hindu epic of Ramayana as it is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama. This religious town is also the birthplace of four of Jainism's 24 Tirthankaras (religious teachers), beckoning tourists with its serene ghats.

With monkeys galore, the buzz of the visiting tourists, and a general spiritual aura, Ayodhya has been surrounded by controversy since about a decade now. It is the site of the 1992 Indian riots related to the Babri Masjid fiasco. The mosque, which was allegedly built on Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, became the bone of contention between Hindus and Muslims. In 2005, Ayodhya witnessed a terrorist attack at the site of Ramlalla Temple.

Despite the controversy, Ayodhya has so much colour and spirituality to see for its tourists and has emerged as a significant spiritual centre. The land of multi-faith temples, the traffic-free streets of Ayodhya are intriguing enough in itself to warrant a visit.

              The city of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh is a definite addition to every history buff or traveller who sets foot in this state. Sitting at the very south in the Bundelkhand region and built on the banks of the Betwa and Pahunch rivers, Jhansi is popular as the place where Rani Laxmi Bai, who is also referred to as ‚ÄúJhansi Ki Rani‚Äù, lived and reigned. 

Jhansi gets its name from the Jhansi Fort built by Raja Bir Singh Deo who named it so as the rulers could only see a shadow atop a distant hill when gazing at the fort. The historical city was also the seat of the Chandela Dynasties power. Jhansi was originally known as Balwantnagar, which was a walled city built around a fort. 

These facts and the variety of monuments and essential landmarks down to the streets of the city show that Jhansi has a string of historical evidence which is dug deep into its roots and is one of the main reasons individuals are drawn to this city.

Kanpur has established itself in the pages of history, being a part of major dynasties and an important British garrison town until 1947.

The bloody tale of the capture of Kanpur by various rulers is recorded all over the city in different architectures, museums, books and by the oral legends. Kanpur was believed to have been established by king Hindu Singh Chandel of Sachendi, initially naming it as 'Kanhiyapur' because it was said to be founded on the birthday of the Hindu god, Lord Krishna. Later on, in its way to acquire the name ‚ÄòKanpur‚Äô, it was known as Kanhapur, Caunpoore and Cawnpore. Many old texts suggest that it derived its name from the legendary character of Mahabharata, Karna, as it was called Karnapur too.

A sacred land that holds importance to the Hindus, Jains and Buddhists alike, Sravasti is a cultural paradise, that lies in the heart of Uttar Pradesh. Monasteries from Thailand, Tibet and Korea bring to life every architect's dream. A city that holds the ancient Bodhi Vriksh (tree) is not unfamiliar with the legends and myths of Ramayana. Shravasti is also the birthplace of Tirthankar - the founder of Jainism.

Thus, this region holds great importance for the devotees of three religions, who annually visit in huge numbers. Shravasti which comes from the words, "Sabbam atthi", stands for peace and prosperity, which is reinforced by each ring of the Japanese World Peace Bell.

              The epic Ramayana, states that it is a city that was created by Lord Ram, when he divided the kingdom of Kosala, into Shravasti and Kushavati. While Shravasti was to be ruled by Lav, Lord Ram's son, Kusha, the other son was made the ruler of Kushavati. Another epic, Mahabharata, traces the history of this city back to King Shravasta. Shravasti also holds great spiritual significance in Buddhism and Jainism. It is believed that the region houses many relics and architectures from the era of Gautam Buddha and Mahaveer.
